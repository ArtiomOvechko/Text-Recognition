Welcome to Text Recognition Application by Artiom Ovechko!

=======================================
BASIC INFO
=======================================
Text Recognition Application uses perceptron network 
machine learning classification algorythm, so program
can be "trained" to recognize new symbols. It works better
when each of character has been shown to programm the same
number of times. All of trained data stored in alphabet.xml
file, so you can save it wherever you want and continue 
train programm.

=======================================
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
=======================================
There are 3 different trained alphabets present in .zip archive
standalone folder: 3-5-7 training examples per character in all 
alphabets accordingly. You can copy any of them into core folder 
and test it efficiency by drawing characters.

THANKS
=======================================
Great thanks to Frank Rosenblatt for his perceptron!
